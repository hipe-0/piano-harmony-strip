- Instant inspiration !
- Easy: No musical experience needed. Not even piano experience needed
- Fun !
- All 12 musical key

- Root note for all chords is symbolised by a rectangle. Useful to use for playing bass notes.
- This includes the harmonized diminished chords (in grey) which is usually less useful

# Bill of Material:
- a single sheet of paper (A4 or letter format is ok)
- Cisors
- Glue
- a printer
- a piano or piano keyboard
- a ruler with milimeter display
- about 5-15 min of time to assemble (very easy)

# Improvements and enhancements, maybe for future or alternative versions. What do you think?
- Try this : add the 4 note chords. For jazzy sound. I have tested the concept it works.
- Try this : add the suspended chords
- Try this : add the 6th chords
- remove the diminished chords for simplicity
- remove the parallel chords for simplicity
- black and white strip : I have tried it. It works but it's less fun

# Want more from this? Explore the modes. Here is a quick reminder
1. **Ionian** (Root note is the black rectangle with red inside): This is your standard major scale. **Happy and bright**.
2. Dorian: Minor with a bit of a jazzy feel.
3. Phrygian: Minor with a Spanish flair.
4. Lydian: Major with a dreamy quality, thanks to the raised fourth.
5. Mixolydian: Major with a bluesy twist, due to the lowered seventh.
6. **Aeolian** (Root note is the black rectangle with blue inside): Your natural minor scale. **Sad and somber**.
7. Locrian: Dark and unsettling, with a diminished fifth.
