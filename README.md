# How to use (beginer)
- Place your strip anywhere on the top of the keyboard, sitting on the black keys
- Fold and push the tip of the left label between 2 notes so that it locked in place and doesn't move too easily.
- Locate 3 piano notes side by side with same color on the same line. (Ignore the small circles at first)
- Hit the note either together or in succession (arpeggio)
- Move your fingers, select another group of 3 notes either different color or different line, you choose, repeat
- All your notes are in harmony.
- Remember: Don't mix colors, it will not sound good
- Remember : Don't cross lines, it will not sound good
- Add a second hand to play along with your first hand. Apply the same rules. you can add for example a single bass note (rectangle notes are better than rounded notes for this)
- Choose a root note (blackened rectangle, red for happy, blue for sad). Start, finish and move around this note to set a mood. 
- Hit the small circles instead of the big notes to add harmonic variety (parallel chord, it swaps major / minor chord)
  
# Improvements and enhancements you can do
- Advanced and fun: perform a full tonal change like a pro by sliding the strip by x notes either left or right for a few chords and then come back (try x= 2, 6, 7 to sound smooth, feel free to experiment)
- Add 4-note chords to the strip for jazzy sounds.
- Include suspended and 6th chords to the strip.
- Remove diminished (grey notes) or parallel chords (small circles) if you don't like them or for a more simple approach.
- Print in Black & white.
- Add Roman numerals on root notes.
