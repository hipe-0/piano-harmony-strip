# Harmony guide to print for any piano size
  by Hippolyte Mounier, 2024

# features

- This strip can guide you in your melodic exploration of the keyboard.
- Instant inspiration.
- Easy: No musical experience needed. Not even piano experience needed.
- Fun
- All 12 musical key
- All 7 musical modes
- 2 Black marks highlight the root note for Ionian and Aeolian (major and minor modes)
- Simple color code: Red for major, blue for minor
- All inversions
- All harmonized 3 note chords
- This includes the harmonized diminished chords (in grey) which is usually less useful
- Optional but real fun to use : All parallel chords (swaps between major and minor chords) symbolized as smaller circles.
- Hit the small circle alternative instead of the bigger one.

# How to print
- You can print the strip as a PDF file yourself at home
- A generator will adapt the PDF size to your keyboard size. You can enter any keyboard size in the interface.
- Future versions could include 4 note chords for jazzy sound. I have tested the concept it works.
