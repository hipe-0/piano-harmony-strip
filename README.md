# How to use (beginer)
- Place your strip at the base of the keys, sitting on the black keys. Align to the notes.
- Fold and stick the tip of the left label between 2 notes. This will prevent the strip to move freely.
- Locate 3 colored markers on one line with same color. (Ignore the small circles at first)
- Hit the the corresponding 3 notes on the piano. You can play them either together (chord) or in succession (arpeggio)
- Move your fingers, locate another group of 3 markers either with a different color or on a different line, repeat
- All your notes are in harmony.
- Remember: Don't mix colors
- Remember: Don't cross lines

# With more practice
- You can add a second hand to play along with your first hand. The same rules apply for the second hand.
- You can add for example a single bass note using your left hand (rectangle notes are the root notes of the chord and are usually better for this)
- You can choose a Tonal note (blackened rectangle, red is Ionian for happy, blue is Eolian for sad). Start, finish and move around this special note to set a mood. 
- You can Hit the small circles instead of the big markers to add **harmonic variety** (parallel chord, it swaps between major / minor chord)
- Advanced and fun: perform a full **tonal change** like a pro by sliding the strip by x notes either left or right for a few chords and then come back (x= 2, 5 or 7 to sound smoothest, feel free to experiment)

  
# Improvements and enhancements to the strip you can do
- Add 4-note chords to the strip for jazzy sounds.
- Include suspended and 6th chords to the strip.
- Remove diminished (grey notes) or parallel chords (small circles) if you don't like them or for a more simple approach.
- Print in Black & white.
- Add Roman numerals on root notes.
